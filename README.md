## Approximating \( e \) Using a Geometric Representation of the Maclaurin Series

### Steps

1. **Draw a Line Segment**: Use a ruler to draw a line segment of a known length \( L \). For example, let \( L = 10 \) cm for ease of calculation.

2. **Mark Off Segments**: Use the ruler and straightedge to mark off segments according to the factorials:
    - The first segment would be \( \frac{L}{2!} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) cm.
    - The second segment would be \( \frac{L}{3!} = \frac{10}{6} \approx 1.67 \) cm.
    - The third segment would be \( \frac{L}{4!} = \frac{10}{24} \approx 0.42 \) cm.
    - And so on.

3. **Add Them Up**: Add up the lengths of these segments. The sum of these segments would theoretically approach \( 10 \times (e^{-1}) \).

4. **Calculate \( e \)**: Divide the total length of all segments by \( L \) and add 1. The result should approximate \( e \)!
